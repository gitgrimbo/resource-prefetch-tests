# resource-prefetch-tests

Runs a series of tests to discover which approaches to prefetching resources
work in a browser.

# Install

`git clone https://github.com/gitgrimbo/resource-prefetch-tests.git`

# Usage

First, start the server.

`node server`

Second, point your browser at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).

Third, click the `Start` button. The tests will run, and the results will be
displayed in the browser (as each individual test completes) and saved to disk
(when all the tests are complete, to the `./_sessions` folder).

# Results

What do the results look like?

- [https://gitgrimbo.github.io/resource-prefetch-tests/](https://gitgrimbo.github.io/resource-prefetch-tests/)

Or clone the repo and take a look at [./samples/results.html](./samples/results.html).

Also see [./samples/session.json](./samples/session.json).

# Why?

By prefetching resources we hope to speed up subsequent user interactions
with our site.

If we can prefetch required resources into the browser's cache
before they are needed, then fetching those resources when they *are* needed
should be much faster, as the browser has them in its cache.

# The Tests

The tests are built up from combining the following dimensions:

- prefetch approach
- resource type
- resource size
- CORS/non-CORS

## Prefetch approaches tested

These are the implementations of prefetch that are tested.

- `<link rel="prefetch" href="url">` - [Link prefetching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Link_prefetching_FAQ).
- `new Image().src = url;` - [Preloading and the JavaScript Image() object](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/preloading-and-the-javascript-image-object/).
- `<object data="url">` - [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object).
- [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

## Resource types tested

These are the resource types that are tested.  Some prefetch implementations
work for some resources types but not others.

- JPG
- JS
- CSS
- WOFF

## Resource sizes tested

There are 'large', 'medium' and 'small' versions of JPG, CSS and JS.

The test server also deliberately throttles the bandwidth available to the test
resources. This is because some browsers reject (do not download and/or do
not cache) resources once they realise the resource is not the expected
content type. E.g. Firefox 49 and IE 11 will reject (not cache) non-image
resources prefetched using the `new Image().src = url` approach, but Chrome 53
caches these resources successfully.

Having large, medium and small resources, plus the bandwidth throttling,
facilitates exposing this browser behaviour.

## CORS and non-CORS

Each resource+approach combination is also tested with CORS and non-CORS requests.

A request with the `useCors=true` query parameter will instruct the test server
to add the CORS HTTP response headers.
